# homework 1: data types and variables

Open a new Google Colab document. Make sure your name and "Homework01" is in the title of the document. 

Then, complete the following tasks as separate cells/commands within the document, following the same order as the prompts:  

1. Save your first name to a variable called `first`. 
2. Save your age to a variable called `age`. 
3. Use "f-string" formatting to run the following line of code: `f"my name is {first}, and my age is {age}"`. For more information on f-strings, [see this post](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/python-f-strings-literal-string-interpolation).
4. Save your last name to a variable called `last`.
5. Use string concatenatation (when you add one string to another using `+`) to print your first and last names together. 
6. Add the number `10` to your age variable. This should create an error.
7. Using a comment, beginning with a `#`, explain why the above line of code doesn't work (hint: pay attention to the data types).
8. Use a string method, like `.upper() ` or `.lower()`, to change the contents of your first or last name.  


When you are finished, download the file as an `.ipynb` file, and submit the assignment by uploading it to [this folder on Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1HIYknpWgEZUqM8ERekDdRN5JSJaPhb9C?usp=sharing)
