    "- Choose one text by a man and one text by a woman.\n",
    "- Load and clean the text using the functions defined in the `nltk: text analysis` class notes.\n",
    "- Do some text analysis using at least four NLTK methods like:\n",

    "    - check word counts with `text.vocab().most_common(20)` \n",
    "- Write a paragraph (5 - 7 sentences) about your results, and answer the following questions:\n",
    "   - What did you discover about the way gender is portrayed across the two texts? How is gender being characterized across texts?\n",
    "   - Explain some conclusions you might draw about gender or the text from specific words that appear in your analysis.\n",
    "   - Based on your exploration so far, what kind of further questions could you ask about the topic or data?\n",
