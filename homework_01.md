# homework 1: create a project folder
Demonstrate you have created a course folder for this course using the command line.

- First, using the command line, create a folder for this course somewhere that makes sense for your own directory structure in your computer. For example, I created my course folder within my Desktop folder. 
- Then, go to the “parent” folder (the one that contains your course folder). For example, if the course folder is on your Desktop, the parent folder is your Desktop folder.
- Then, run the command for “list.” After running this command, you should see your course folder on the list. 
- Copy and paste the output into a blank document, such as a word document or another word processor.
- Below this pasted text, write a short paragraph explaining any trouble you had with this homework and how you tried to figure it out. If you had no trouble with this homework, instead write a short paragraph explaining where you chose to create your folder on your computer and why you chose that location.
