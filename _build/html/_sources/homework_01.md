# homework 1: data types and variables

Open a command line program (Terminal or Powershell) or a new Google Colab document. Complete the following tasks as separate cells/commands within the document, following the same order as the prompts:  

1. Save your first name to a variable called "first". 
2. Save your age to a variable called "age." 
3. Run the following line of code: `f"my name is {name}, and my age is {age}"
4. Save your last name to a variable called "last".
5. Use string concatenatation to print your first and last names together. 
6. Use string concatenation to add the number `10` to your age. This should create an error.
7. Using a comment, beginning with a `#`, explain why the above line of code doesn't work (hint: pay attention to the data types).
8. Use a string method, like `.upper() ` or `.lower()`, to change the contents of your first or last name.
