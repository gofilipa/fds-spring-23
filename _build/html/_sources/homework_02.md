# homework 2: functions and loops
Write a function which contains a loop that prints your the names of your favorite movies, tv shows, books, and/or music. 

In a comment below the function, include a short paragraph explaining any trouble you had with this homework and how you tried to figure it out. If you had no trouble with this homework, instead write a short paragraph explaining in your own words how a loop works, as best you can. Submit your homework as a `.ipynb` file.
