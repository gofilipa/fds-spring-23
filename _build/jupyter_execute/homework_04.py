# For this assignment, you will choose a focus: either **genders** or **monsters**. 
# 
# If you choose **genders**, do the following:
# - Choose one text by a man and one text by a woman.
# - Load and clean the text using the functions defined in the `nltk: text analysis` class notes.
# - Do some text analysis using at least four NLTK methods like:
#     - `similar()`, `concordance()`, `distribution_plot([])`, `collocations()`, and `common_contexts([])`
#     - check word counts with `text.vocab().most_common(20)` 
# - Write a paragraph (5 - 7 sentences) about your results, and answer the following questions:
#    - What did you discover about the way gender is portrayed across the two texts? 
#    - Based on your exploration so far, what kind of further questions could you ask about the topic or data?
#
