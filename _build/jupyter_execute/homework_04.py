# ## instructions
# For this assignment, you will choose a focus: either **genders** or **monsters**. 
# 
# If you choose **genders**, do the following:
# - Choose one text by a man and one text by a woman.
# - Load and clean the text using the functions defined in the `nltk: text analysis` class notes.
# - Do some text analysis using at least four NLTK methods like:
#     - `similar()`, `concordance()`, `distribution_plot([])`, `collocations()`, and `common_contexts([])`
#     - check word counts with `text.vocab().most_common(20)` 
# - Write a paragraph (5 - 7 sentences) about your results, and answer the following questions:
#    - What did you discover about the way gender is portrayed across the two texts? How is gender being characterized across texts?
#    - Explain some conclusions you might draw about gender or the text from specific words that appear in your analysis.
#    - Based on your exploration so far, what kind of further questions could you ask about the topic or data?
# 
# If you choose **monsters**, do the following:
# - Select two texts, *Dracula* and *Frankenstein*.
# - Load and clean the text using the functions defined in the `nltk: text analysis` class notes.
# - Do some text analysis using at least four NLTK methods like:
#     - `similar()`, `concordance()`, `distribution_plot([])`, `collocations()`, and `common_contexts([])`
#     - check word counts with `text.vocab().most_common(20)` 
# - Write a paragraph (5 - 7 sentences) about your results, and answer the following questions:
#    - What did you discover about the way monsters are portrayed across the two texts? How are they monsters being characterized across texts?
#    - Explain some conclusions you might draw about monsters from specific words that appear in your analysis.
#    - Based on your exploration so far, what kind of further questions could you ask about the topic or the texts?

# In[1]:


# first, below this cell, select and clean your texts
# use the clean() function and the variables set to URL from the class notes


# In[2]:


# second, below this cell, do some text analysis with NLTK across both texts
# use the nltk methods specified above
# remember to first create an "nltk object" from your text


# In[3]:


# third, below this cell, write a paragraph about your results
# make sure to answer all questions from the prompt above
