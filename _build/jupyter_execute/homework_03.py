# # homework 3: text cleaning

# First, choose a text that you've read/seen before, maybe from the Project Gutenburg library. 
# 
# Second, in a cell below load up your text into a Jupyter notebook or Google Colab notebook. 
# 

# Third, tokenize the text. 

# Fourth, write a loop to remove stopwords.

# Fifth, write a loop to remove punctuation and capital leters. Make sure you save the cleaned text to a new variable.

# Bonus: 
# Combine all of the cleaning steps (removing stopwords, punctuation, capital letters) within a single function called "clean" which you can then call on the text.
