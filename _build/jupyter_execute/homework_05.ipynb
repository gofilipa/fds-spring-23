    "# homework 4: data exploration\n",
    "\n",
    "In this assignment, you will demonstrate your knowledge of the Python and Pandas skills we've learned so far. These include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Getting an overview of your data\n",
    "- Extracting columns\n",
    "- Getting fundamental statistical information of a series, such as the mean and median\n",
    "- Getting a random sample of your data\n",
    "- Creating a subset of your data using indexing with boolean lists\n",
    "- Sorting your data\n",
    "- Indexing by matching a string\n",
    "\n",
    "You will not need to formulate or answer a research question for this assignment. You simply need to demonstrate your ability to perform specific operations on the data set you have selected. In the next assignment, your midterm, you will create a narrative exploration of the data using many of the same methods, but in such a way as to use narrative along with data analysis to answer a research question.\n",
    "\n",
    "You may use the data set you imported in assignment #1, or you may choose another data set. That means that you can reuse code you wrote in Assignment #1 to import the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the below notebook, I will ask for you to perform a task. Each task will be followed by one or more blank code cells. Use as many cells as you need to complete the task. If you know some other way to complete the task with Python and/or Pandas that is not the way we learned in class, that is also acceptable. Feel free to use Google searches to refresh your memory as to how to perform each task. You will also likely wish to consult the class notebooks, which have been emailed to you after class and which can be found in [our class repository on GitHub](https://github.com/smythp/foundations-data-science/tree/master/class_notebooks).\n",
    "\n",
    "If your data set does not have a needed form of data for a task, write code that would perform the task if a column with that data existed, and provide an explanation as a comment or markdown cell.\n",
    "\n",
    "You may receive partial credit for some incomplete or incorrect answers. Please feel free to add comments about your thought process, which will make it more likely that you will receive partial credit.\n",
    "\n",
    "The last cell is a bonus. You will not be penalized for not attempting or completing it.\n",
